		<h3> At AccessAble, we aim to improve access to mental health care and services in the United States</h3>
	  <p> AccessAble intends to provide quality and up to date information about the lack of and need for mental health services in the United States and to influence policy around mental health services by contacting and lobbying national, state, and local policy makers. 

		Solutions /*LINK*/ are out there! Will you join the fight?

	  <h3> Background </h3>
	  <p> <b> A main goal of AccessAble </b> is to educate those affected by lack of access to Mental health services, policy makers, and the public about challenges in accessing care in the U.S. Bringing Awareness to Mental Health and America’s Mental Health “Crisis” is the first step in improving access for all. Many do not seek help due to fear of stigma, lack of knowledge on mental health, and lack of knowledge on services available. </p>

		<h3> What is "Mental Health"?</h3>
	  <p> Mental Health is the state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with stresses in life, realize their abilities, learn and work well, and contribute to the community. It is a necessary and inherent part of overall health and wellbeing. <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-health-strengthening-our-response" class="hover-link">The World Health Organization explains what quality mental health care looks like.</a> </p>

  <div class="boxmain">
	  <h3> Why Does It Matter?</h3>
	 <p>Mental health plays a role in every aspect of your life. From handling stress and emotions to decision making to everyday functioning. Poor mental health or those suffering from mental illness, which is exacerbated by lack of access to treatment, may find everyday functioning difficult, may be under extreme stress which affects physical health as well, and may deteriorate to the point of being a danger to themselves or others. </p>

	  	<h3> 90% of adults polled that the U.S. is experiencing a 'Mental Health CRISIS' </h3>
		<p> <a href = "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/health/cnn-kff-mental-health-poll-wellness/index.html" class = "hover-link"> <small> according to a CNN/KFF poll. </small></a> </p> 
		 <p> According to the <a href = "https://www.mhanational.org/issues/state-mental-health-america" class= "hover-link"> State of Mental Health in America (MHA) </a> report, the number of people in the US with mental health struggles is steadily increasing and many face barriers to getting care. Over half (54.7%) of adults with a mental illness do not receive treatment, totaling over 28 million individuals. Almost a third (28.2%) of all adults with a mental illness reported that they were not able to receive the treatment they needed and sought out.  </p>
		
		<h3> Children also need mental health care! Children are also lacking access to proper care! </h3>
		<p> <a href = "https://www.mhanational.org/issues/state-mental-health-america" class= "hover-link"> MHA also reports </a> over 1 in 10 (11.5%) youth in the U.S. are experiencing depression that severely impairs their ability to function normally.	59.8% of youth with major depression do not receive any mental health treatment.  </p>

	<div class="boxside">
		<h3> This is a preventable problem! There IS a solution!</h3>
	  <p> By making mental health care an important cause for each of us and informing policy makers of it's priority, we can help improve access to mental health care in the United States! The solution starts with brining awareness to issues in policy surrounding mental health care and pressuring for change!  <br> 
		  
	<br> Proper Mental Health is important for each of us. And each of us can work to improve mental health care for all of us! </p>
		<h3> Contact your policy makers now! Make your voice heard. Make mental health care a priority!</h3>
